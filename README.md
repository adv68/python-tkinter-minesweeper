# CIS 365 Project 

## Exploring neural networks with minesweeper

The files in this repository are as follows:

* minesweeper.py - the main minesweeper game. Only a few helper functions are added for the agent
* agent.py - runs the minesweeper agent. Agents can be configured in the python file
* networktrainer.py - trains a keras neural network from data in "trainingdata.csv"
* *.csv - various files containing training data
* ml.net directory - contains files for ML.NET project
  * MinesweeperML.NET contains the model builder configuration and boilerplate code
  * MLModel1_WebApi1 contains the API used for interop between the python game and the ML.NET model - the binary generated by this project must be running for the ML.NET agent to work
* keras_model* - directories containing some of the keras models we trained
